Prior knowledge can help human solve problems very quickly, so can RL use the same prior knowledge like us?
How is the knowledge stored?
- Q-function: tells us which actions or states are good
- Policy: tells us which policy are potentially useful
- Models: what are the laws of physics that govern the world
- Features/Hidden states: provide us with a good representation
# Transfer Learning
**Terminology**: transfer learning, using experience from *one set of tasks* for faster learning and better performance on a *new task*.
In RL, **task** = **MDP**!
# Meta Learning
## Meta RL
