# Lecture 1
众所周知，第一节课什么都不教。
# Lecture 2 Boot, Process, Kernel
## Booting
BIOS -> bootloader -> kernel
## Process
### Process in Memory
Stack: 临时变量
Heap: 全局变量
## Kernel
### Limited Direct Execution
OS needs to check the instructions to be executed, in order to prevent detrimental behavior.
"Sensitive" instructions go through OS, most instructions run directly on CPU, which ensures good performance and good isolation.
The following instructions are limited:
1. Restricted operations (特权指令)
2. inter-process switching: voluntary and involuntary switching like timer interrupt (时钟中断)
### Dual Mode
User mode (用户态) and kernel mode (内核态) 这两者都是 CPU 的状态，由 OS 控制。
### Privileged Instructions (特权指令)
I/O read/write, context switch, changing privilege level, set system time... Any instructions that *could affect other processes* are likely to be privileged.
