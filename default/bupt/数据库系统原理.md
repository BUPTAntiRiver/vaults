**Some terms**:
Model: an abstract description, it feels like a Math formula with only symbols but no meanings.

# Chapter 2 Relational Model
## Structure of Relational Database
**A relational database** consists of *a collection of tables*.
Row: tuple
Col: attributes
They are both unordered.
## Keys
**Super key** is a set of one or more attributes, that can be used to *identify uniquely* a tuple in the relation.
**Candidate key** the minimal super key, attributes in candidate key are called primary attributes.
**Primary key** is a candidate key as *principal means* to identify tuples.
### Foreign key
Describing relationship among relations, e.g. a instructor belongs to a department.
If $X$ is one or more attributes in schema $r_{1}$ and $X$ is also the **primary key** of another schema $r_{2}$, then $X$ is a foreign key in $r_{1}$.
