# Chapter 1 Introduction
Let's clarify some concepts first:
- Database (DB): a collection of **interrelated data**, stored as files.
- Database Management System (DBMS): a program to access DB. Responsible for **definition** of structures for storage of information, **data manipulation** mechanisms and **safety** mechanisms.

## Database Engine (DBMS)
**Definition**: A DBMS is partitioned into modules that deal with each responsibility.
- query processor
- storage manager
- transaction management

They will be introduced later.
