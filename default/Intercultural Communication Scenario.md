1. Aiyana's silence might shows that the Native Americans are excluded by the Americans in the history and that phenomenon still has its impact nowadays, she may not have a group of friends during her growth, so she need a period of silence to prepare her words, she takes the conversation seriously.
   Liu Wei's minimal spoken disagreement might show Chinese are more likely to do some stuff rather than just speaking because he typed a lot in the chat, but they also make their attitude clear.
   Charlotte's understated humor signifies British culture appreciates constrained emotion.
   Jackson's rapid speech signifies American culture encourages people to be open and share their mind, so called "speech freedom".
2. Aiyana may not speak that much and she thinks her words should be prepared so she takes the silence to do so, and in Chinese culture, we have a word "silence is gold", so Liu Wei also can bear the silence, while in American's culture, they are encouraged to speak their mind freely, so Jackson thought less before he speaks and he meets silence less in his daily life, so he said something to fill the blank, Charlotte acted like a humor gentleman.

1. Let Jackson take the lead to talk and mainly discuss with Charlotte, after a period of discussion, let Aiyana make a brief summary and tell her opinions on the topic, then repeat. Liu Wei is responsible for making record and writing the final conclusion.
2. Jackson is the person who speaks most, so let him take the lead to output as many ideas as possible, and Charlotte prefers to response to others words, so he probably can have pretty good interaction with Jackson. And Aiyana takes some time to think so she might spend more time to sum up her opinions and when she is ready she can share it with everybody. Liu Wei has a good ability at typing and he also talks even less, so he suits recording content and generating final output of their discussion.
