I am preparing for the coming postgraduate exam, so I want to write a review about calculus also a tutorial look aside that may help beginners in college. I will try to make this article not just a stiff copy and paste of formulas, but also can introduce the story, logic, intuition and even beauty behind them.
## Differentiation
Given a value – the price of gas, the pressure in a tank, or your distance from Boston – how can we describe changes in that value? Differentiation is a valuable technique for answering questions like this.
### Definition and Basic Rules
This section explains what differentiation is and gives rules for differentiating familiar functions.
#### Introduction to Derivatives
We are going to introduce what is derivative in Geometric Interpretation, Physical Interpretation and its importance to *all* measurements.
##### Geometric Interpretation
Let's start with asking a geometric question.
## Vectors and Matrices
### Vectors, Determinants and Planes
