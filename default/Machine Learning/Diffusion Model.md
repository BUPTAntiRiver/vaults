# Basic Concepts
It has two process: forward and backward. In **forward**, we "destroy" the data, making it noisier, in **backward**, we denoise the data, try to retrieve it back, the backward step is **generative**.
# some stuff
The difference between diffusion models and GANs is that the generative step of diffusion model is iterative while GAN only takes one step.
