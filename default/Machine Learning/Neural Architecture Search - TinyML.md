# What
Neural Architecture Search is a method to search for the possible structures of neural networks and reshape them into that, which can reduce latency and model size and even reach higher accuracy.
# Why
To reach to goal of tiny machine learning! This is an effective way to reduce model size and find better model structure.
# How
## Search Strategy
### Grid Search
Adjust the depth, width, channel numbers and compound scaling.
### Random Search
### Gradient Descent
### Evolutionary Search
- Mimic the evolution process in Biology.
- Fitness function: $F(\text{accuracy}, \text{efficiency})$.
- Mutation: change the depth, operators.
- Crossover: Randomly choose one operator among the two choices(from the parents) for each layer.
