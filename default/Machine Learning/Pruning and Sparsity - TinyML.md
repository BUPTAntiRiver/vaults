# Pruning criterion
We remove the parameters that are **less important**.
## Synapse Pruning
### Magnitude-based Pruning
### Scaling-based Pruning
### Second-Order-based Pruning
## Neuron Pruning
### Percentage-of-Zero-Based Pruning
### Regression-based Pruning
Minimize reconstruction error of the corresponding layer's outputs.
# How to find pruning ratio?
## Analyze the sensitivity of each layer
Set an accuracy threshold, and choose the pruning rate for each layer base on it.
## AMC: AutoML for Model Compression
Pruning as a reinforcement learning problem.
