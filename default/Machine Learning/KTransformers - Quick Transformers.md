# What is KTransformers

KTransformers is a Python-centric software framework designed for optimizing inference of large language models (LLMs) and transformer architectures. It’s developed under the GitHub project “kvcache-ai/ktransformers”. [GitHub](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/ktransformers?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
Key features:

- It lets you inject optimized modules (kernels) into existing transformer models (e.g., replacing standard linear layers or attention modules) via a template/“injection” mechanism. [GitHub](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/ktransformers?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- It supports deployments on heterogeneous hardware (GPU, CPU, various accelerators) with optimised kernels for quantised weights, offloading, longer context, etc. [GitHub](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/ktransformers?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- It offers compatibility with the popular Transformers ecosystem (Hugging Face / AutoModel) and also RESTful APIs compatible with OpenAI-style interfaces. [GitHub](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/ktransformers?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- Their aim is especially local deployment, i.e., being able to run large models with resource constraints, e.g., limited GPU memory, leveraging smart offloading, quantisation, etc. [GitHub](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/ktransformers?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
